# Of all the components, it seems like the oscillatory component explains the greatest amount of the variation seen in the original plot from above. Seem to be at least 6 cycles in unemployment over the years, seemingly pretty irregular. Trend explains some of the variance, but there doesn't seem to be much of an actual pattern to it, slow increase until 1980 then a slight decrease until 2000 and a slight increase again after that. Seasonal variation regularly explains a decent amount of the variation, so seasonality deffinitely has an impact on unemployment, but it isn't huge, and interestingly it seems to be decreasing with time.
